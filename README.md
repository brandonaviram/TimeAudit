# TimeAudit

This script powers an application I built to monitor my workflow. The app prompts me every 25 minutes to log what I’m working on. At the end of the day, I quit the app and feed the log into a custom GPT model I’ve created. This model analyzes my log, helping me discover patterns and gain insights into how I’ve spent my time.
